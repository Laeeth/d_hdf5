		<p>Hi.</p>
<p>My background &#8211; Cambridge (Trinity) Economics, DE Shaw, Citadel, startup macro fund.&nbsp; I appreciate technology (at school I designed computers for fun) but at the same time I think we lose a great deal by applying it in a way that is not conscious or thought-through.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have time to write much for now.&nbsp; But I do agree with David Friedman about the importance of bitcoin, or bitcoin-like technologies.&nbsp; It is a classic development out of the Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma by Clayton Christensen.&nbsp; New innovations often begin at the low end and have many unsatisfactory attributes; over time the bugs are worked out and a supporting infrastructure emerges.&nbsp; By the time the incumbents realize the threat it may be too late to kill the incumbent.&nbsp; (And it&#8217;s not clear what established financial institutions might be able to offer in the place of bitcoin).</p>
<p>The reason it has broader significance for financial markets and the economy is that it comes in the context of the financial industry being &#8216;blown to bits&#8217; &#8211; as a former inv bank CEO remarked to me, what happened to the music business is now happening to banking.</p>
<p>Money performs three functions: unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value.&nbsp; Bitcoin is a horrible unit of account, not so great as a store of value (for non-speculators), but a very effective medium of exchange (especially in certain contexts: today including the black+grey economies and emerging markets, but the useable domains will widen with time).&nbsp; So the concerns about deflation due to fixed supply are utterly specious (I have longer blog post if interested).</p>
<p>This relates to some work done in the 90s and earlier on the &#8216;new monetary economics&#8217; &#8211; on which topic the best book is by Randall Kroszner (now senior at the Fed) and Tyler Cowen (of <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal REVOLUTION</a>).<br />Why are commercial and retail banks necessary?&nbsp; A textbook says that they are important for the payments system, to hold deposits, and for their provision of lending services.&nbsp; Each of these functions can now to a certain extent be provided by alternative institutions and market structures, and this extent will grow very significantly over the coming decade.&nbsp; Money market mutual funds have long substituted for deposits (let&#8217;s abstract away from questions of credit quality for now); bitcoin has demonstrated that non-bank payment systems are quite feasible; and lending is changing too.</p>
<p>In the past banks had a monopoly on being able to make informed lending decisions because they were the only ones that knew the borrower.&nbsp; On the one hand, branch managers would actually often have personal contact with the borrower; and on the other, transaction data would be stuck with the bank and nobody else could easily get access to it.&nbsp; Clearly that has changed on both fronts &#8211; in many countries there has been a hollowing out of expertise so that branch managers do not truly know their customers anymore; and on the other, accessing and processing transaction data is a completely different game today.<br />So hedge fund lending (as well as to a small extent today, crowd funding and crowd lending) has started to become a credible substitute for bank lending in many domains, and these domains will grow over time as these financial innovations mature and make better use of technology.&nbsp; As is often the case, it starts at the fringe and in niche uses &#8211; but what is niche today becomes mainstream in a decade.<br />The consequence is that one can imagine a situation (which I imagine is not so unlikely) where banks no longer have the strategic importance that they do today.&nbsp; Because if a bank goes bust the cash machines keep functioning, and firms are continue to able to access credit.&nbsp; This will have important implications for how they are regulated, and should we reach this stage, one could imagine the withering away of deposit insurance and the moral hazard that accompanies it.</p>
<p>With regards to the investment side, I agree on the one hand that there is much more mileage left in the further application of technology to the investment process, but on the other I think that we are starting to see the limits of pure analysis (and therefore the benefits of other kinds of thinking that are not purely analytical).<br />For the former point, one can go elsewhere for discussion of the impact of big data and machine learning on the financial industry.&nbsp; (It&#8217;s a super important development, but hard to summarize in a powerful way because it changes every part of the investment process).</p>
<p>For the latter point, I think what is key is that no analytical approach anticipated the 2008 crisis (and many did not anticipate the recovery in 2009, only responding to it fairly late).&nbsp; And of those who did see things coming (Marc Faber, Jim Rogers, Fred Sheehan, and a few others) in a timely way and who were not in the habit of crying wolf, most did so by their use of the application of economic principles in an intuitive manner.</p>
<p>Most models &#8211; even today &#8211; are not very good at anticipating that the music is about to change.&nbsp; For the time being (and perhaps for a very long time indeed) human beings with experience and expertise are very much better.&nbsp; Financial markets are about change, and a Cartesian model cannot capture what is outside its set of parameters.</p>
<p>This being said, technology can act as a tremendous amplifier of discretionary human expertise, so I think we are likely to see some development in this direction.&nbsp; Sentiment and media analysis has been a hot area for a while, mostly for quant models, but they may turn out to be of even greater benefit for enhancing the discretionary investment process.</p>
<p>I hope that was clear enough, and I am open to any questions/disagreements etc.</p>
<p>Laeeth.</p>

		<p>Koppl:</p>
<blockquote><p>I take a rather different view of both economic theory and the crisis in my recent IEA Hobart paper <em><a href="http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/from-crisis-to-confidence-macroeconomics-after-the-crash">From Crisis to Confidence: Macroeconomics after the Crash</a>.</em>
<p>Overall, Blanchard’s message is meant to be reassuring: We the smart macro-finance experts have now got the message on nonlinearities. So no further need to worry, we’ve got the situation in hand. To keep the system out of the “dark corners,” however, we will need more discretionary authority. You don’t mind trading off a bit of financial freedom for greater financial safety do you?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One very simple test to distinguish between the effects of animal spirits and policy uncertainty is to observe the pronouncements and forecasts of policymakers at extremes in asset prices and to relate these to those of financial practitioners, academic economists, and entrepreneurs. Policymakers presumably – even under the most hardcore public choice view of the world – generally believe that their policy is the right one for the circumstances.
<p>If the policy uncertainty view is the more important explanation of things,, it would imply a relative optimism amongst policymakers, perhaps too amongst academics, and a depressed view of things amongst entrepreneurs and financial practitioners.
<p>Beyond looking at patterns of dispersion in forecasts, one may arrive at a tolerable gauge of the affect of a group by applying machine learning techniques to the set of writings generated by this group.
<p>If on the other hand, it is affect that is more important during an episode then one should see complacency and optimism amongst all participants at the peak, and despondency and gloom, at the bottom and for some period afterwards.and one would not expect this pattern of dispersion.
<p>I note that the relative importance of affect versus policy uncertainty need not have direct implications for how activist policy should be. Indeed should it be the case that animal spirits dominate then it constitutes an important reason not to be activist since it means that policy makers suffer from the same perceptual warping experienced by private agents.
<p>My own view, for what it is worth, is that negative affect drives policy uncertainty. The mass emotional response to a downturn is to make sure it doesn’t happen again and to lash out and punish those perceived to be responsible, or any convenient scapegoat failing that. So affect is primary, but policy uncertainty may prolong the downturn.
<p>An implication of this view (for which I do not claim originality) is to expect de facto policy rules loosened as a boom progresses, and tightened after a downturn. Ceteris paribus – there are other factors at play.
<p>Laeeth.</p>

		<h4>Via <a href="http://www.gornahoor.net/?p=7429">Gornahoor</a>:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>What <strong>Abbe Prevost</strong> wrote some 300 years in his novel <em>Manon Lescaut</em> applies all the more today:
<p>The ordinary run of men are susceptible to only five or six passions, within whose compass they live their whole lives, and to which all their emotions are reduced. Remove love and hate, pleasure and pain hope and fear, and there is nothing left for them to feel. But people whose characters are more noble can be stirred in a thousand different ways; it is as if they had more than five senses, and could receive ideas and sensations that transcend the ordinary limits of human nature.
<p>Perhaps this is a slight exaggeration, unless you consider that anger, anxiety, worry—all experienced by moderns—are forms of fear, sexual desire a form of pleasure, and so on. What is missing, however, are feelings of awe, wonder, and reverence. Or shame of one’s nakedness. Or guilt about practices that used to be condemned by well-born and healthy minded men, yet are praised today.
<p>The Knight had deep feelings of loyalty and fidelity to his superiors and his land, which he could never bring himself to broach. Who experiences that today, other than perhaps partisans? Yet they do not look out for the common good, but only for the good of their party.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;In Charles Darwin&#8217;s time there was no great division between serious scientific enquiry and natural history, largely the province of amateurs. Darwin himself was a natural historian, and lived as a private gentleman with no academic post. However, the professionalization of biology which began in the late nineteenth century has now created a wide gulf between academic scientists busily pursuing their careers, and natural historians, studying various aspects of the natural world for the love of doing so. The knowledge and understanding of the naturalist is generally considered to be inferior to that of the professional scientist. But it seems to me that the opposite is true; the knowledge of the naturalist, which comes from an intimate relationship with nature, is deeper and truer than the kind obtained by detached mechanistic analysis. Of course, ideally, the direct experience of the naturalist and the systematic investigations of the professional scientist can complement and illuminate each other. Contemporary examples of such a synthesis are the study of bird migration, which involves a fruitful collaboration between professional scientists and amateur ornithologists, and the wonderfully illuminating accounts of the development of the English countryside by the botanist Oliver Rackham.<br />Knowledge gained through experience of plants and animals is not an inferior substitute for proper scientific knowledge; it is the real thing. Direct experience is the only way to build up an understanding which is not only intellectual, but intuitive and practical, involving the senses and the heart as well as the rational mind. Scientific investigations can illuminate and enrich this direct practical knowledge, but they are no substitute for it &#8212; indeed they depend on it themselves.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Note to a friend:
<p>Our time might be characterized both by a loss of courage, and a remarkable tendency of people in the West to believe that no matter what they may do (or fail to do) they are &#8216;good people&#8217; and without fault.&nbsp; (One is reminded of the murderer who was a patient of &#8216;Theodore Dalrymple&#8217;).&nbsp; A surprising shift indeed given that so many previous generations should have thought themselves to be poor sinners.
<p>I sent before some charts from google ngrams showing interest in religious themes (eg mention of the devil) and truth (mention of truth and of falsehood).&nbsp; Google ngrams counts the incidence of a particular word in the books google has indexed for that year, and shows the time series.
<p>I have been thinking about this topic for almost eight years now, wondering how we moved from the London portrayed by Hogarth (his depiction seems not to be wholly unfair) to that of the Victorians, obviously in the context of what one observed in London nightlife c. 2006 (and later on, it became clear, in the behaviour of business people during the day).
<p>In our Cartesian era, we tend to believe that any kind of shift in society must be driven by a&nbsp; chain of linear causality.&nbsp; Having studied markets for a while now, I have come to be skeptical of this idea &#8211; as applied to markets, but also to broader social trends.&nbsp; Sometimes things just shift of their own accord because people en masse are tired of feeling and acting in certain ways; often, however, there may be an external influence that may not always sit well with our self-conception as autonomous agents.
<p>I took a look now on repentance specifically, and you see a similar pattern (to that of religious interest, and an interest in truth).&nbsp; A climax quite late into the Maunder and Dalton solar minima (from memory, I think truth spiked up quite early).
<p><a href="http://laeeth.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image5.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline" border="0" alt="image" src="http://laeeth.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image_thumb5.png" width="1351" height="508"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to this source (which may be missing some nuances): <a href="http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Repentance">http://psychology.wikia.com/wiki/Repentance</a></p>
<p>In Christianity, &#8220;The chastisements of God are sometimes for the purpose of bringing His wandering children back to repentance&#8221; and indeed these solar minima were certainly times of greater adversity &#8211; higher food prices, and greater mortality (I believe).
<p>Furthermore, I think that what holds people back from admitting their sins is a moral fragility (you have said something similar I think).&nbsp; People deep down fear that if they admit their sins it will be overwhelming; they will not be able to cope, and they will collapse in on themselves.
<p>The ability to confront reality as it is rather than as we wish it would be (and that includes the awful truth about our own weaknesses) is, I believe, linked to morale &#8211; an important concept about which I have been able to find little written in modern times (perhaps due to my lack of skill and knowledge).&nbsp; It seems to be a profound basic variable that exerts a global influence on cognitive perception, processing, and acting.&nbsp; (I am kind of making a link to what Sloman has written about depression as an adaptive response to a person experiencing repeated setbacks, but not accepting their new lower-status position; the neuroendocrine system kicks in to keep them alive in the ancestral environment.&nbsp; Low morale seems to be a sister to depression, but having a highly contagious, mass aspect to it).
<p>I think that colder weather tends to make people more vigorous and to increase morale &#8211; I got this idea from Wheeler but I have found nothing elsewhere on it &#8211; and that too-warm weather makes people lose their nerve and succumb to decadence.&nbsp; One can imagine that in the ancestral environment you didn&#8217;t stay alive long in a cold climate if you gave up too easily.&nbsp; Possibly one might compare the determination of the Germans vs the Italians in WW2, both fighting a hopeless cause.&nbsp; (Incidentally it was very warm then, up until the shocking and unexpected Russian winter which, coincidentally or not, marked the high tide in German fortunes).&nbsp; This idea is of course scientifically indefensible &#8211; I have no studies to point to that I have found.&nbsp; But there might be something to it, even so.
<p>(Cold, wet weather is especially conducive to vigour and morale according to Wheeler.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know how to form a view about rainfall, but I would not be surprised if we are also in a wet era for a while).
<p>So that might be another route by which periods of extended low solar activity (grand minima) lead to higher morale and then to repentance.&nbsp; On the one hand people experience greater adversity, and on the other they are given the moral courage to confront their weaknesses, and recognition of this leads eventually to repentance.
<p>Since I am making indefensible assertions, I would suggest also that people tend more towards monogamy when it is colder.&nbsp; Amusingly, that was the finding of a &#8216;highly scientific&#8217; dating site survey (taken as propaganda by the AGW proponents &#8211; my interest was from a different perspective).
<p>The relevance of all this today, is that many respectable specialists in the field believe the sun entered a grand minimum in 2000 (the Eddy Minimum), and that we have decades of cooling ahead.&nbsp; People have to softsoap the latter to get published &#8211; they say that it will somewhat offset the impact of AGW, but I suspect the reality may be rather different.&nbsp; Ocean cycles are also a factor, but their influence is not straightforward (some of these were only very recently discovered).
<p>I have the idea that such episodes have lasting effects, and it is many decades at least before they are entirely dissipated.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Link here to a Brigham Young speech on repentance:<br />
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=96">http://speeches.byu.edu/?act=viewitem&amp;id=96</a><br />&#8220;While assisting individuals who want to overcome their moral weaknesses, I have noticed problems in how they approach the repentance process. In analyzing these problems, I have found it helpful to organize the elements of repentance under three broad categories.<br />First is self-confrontation. This involves recognizing that a sin has been committed and that repentance is needed. Also, experiencing sorrow or remorse, making confession, and suffering the consequences of having broken the moral law are involved.
<p>The second category concerns self-control. This requires forsaking the sin and developing a pattern of self-regulation that is incorporated into a new and morally benevolent lifestyle.
<p>The third category concerns self-sacrifice. Under this heading I include restitution and reconciling, restoring, forgiving, obeying, and serving.
<p>Today I will focus primarily on the first, self-confrontation, and the third, self-sacrifice, because these are the two areas in which I have frequently noticed deficiencies in our understanding of repentance and in our ability to implement it. To the extent that we fail to fully apply these two phases, we become vulnerable to moral relapse and to repeating the behaviors we had temporarily forsaken. We seem to do a better job of self-control by forsaking immoral conduct for periods of time while we are under the pressure of the repentance process and feeling the direction of the Lord or of a Church authority.
<p>Self-confrontation seems difficult for many of us. It requires understanding how we avoid the truth about ourselves and what is needed to overcome that avoidance. It is said that we must recognize our errors, feel remorse or sorrow, and make confession; but this creates an immediate threat to our self-image—and by nature we tend to protect ourselves from full disclosure of our faults or, when exposed, to justify or rationalize our misconduct.
<p>Evidences of the fears and conflicts that are provoked by self-confrontation arose in a study of sixty BYU students that some of my colleagues and I did with support from the BYU Counseling Center and the BYU Comprehensive Clinic. We found it encouraging that a majority of the students reported abiding by the standards of the gospel. On the other hand, we found among those who had deviated that many avoided the repentance process as outlined in the scriptures and the writings of General Authorities.
<p>Their ways of handling deviations were diverse, such as simply waiting until their feelings of guilt subsided; attempting to convince themselves that what they had done was really not that bad; doing something righteous to balance their account; promising themselves (and God) that they would avoid it the next time; punishing themselves by calling themselves worthless and feeling bad for one or two days; trying not to think about it; and avoiding spiritual contexts because they felt unclean.
<p>These practices represent defense mechanisms (denial, suppression, and rationalization)—their purpose is to defend self-esteem. The students had defined themselves as righteous, and evidence to the contrary threatened their self-images. To follow the practice of confession and repentance would have required them to acknowledge their unrighteous actions. This reflects the problem of emphasizing an external image so much that honest self-disclosure is avoided (see page 97 of Bergin, A. E., Stinchfield, R. D., Gaskin, T. A., Masters, K. S., Sullivan, C. E., “Religious Lifestyles and Mental Health: An Exploratory Study,” Journal of Counseling Psychology 35 [1988]: 91–98).&#8221;</p>

<p>pronounced in Africa and some other emerging regions.&nbsp; (I stripped out things like nagging cough).</p>
<p>This is from google trends search data.</p>
<p>I suspect this relates to a rise in morale &#8211; people no longer willing to put up with things that should be changed, and expression takes the form that is possible, even if perhaps there are better ways.&nbsp; Women are less easily demoralized, perhaps because in history it was less dangerous to assert themselves in womanly ways (whereas a man would get himself killed by persisting following a series of defeats), and so it makes some sense that coming out of the kind of period we are in, women would take the lead in righting wrongs.&nbsp; (This insight I owe to Prechter).</p>
<p>I have not done a study of past periods.&nbsp; Pre internet one would need to select the right columns in the right publications and find some way to categorize articles &#8211; quite a lot of work.&nbsp; I do recall seeing a study by Prechter on the gender composition of political leadership during periods of negative and positive affect.&nbsp; And in Britain during the 80s one was struck by the contrast between the demoralized establishment Conservatives and Thatcher (this observation standing on its own, whatever one&#8217;s political views may be).</p>
<p>I had not seen this when I started writing, but from Wiki this is what Stephen Richey says about Joan of Arc (note the explicit reference to morale):</p>
<p>Historian Stephen W. Richey explains her attraction to the royal court by pointing out that they may have viewed her as the only source of hope for a regime that was near collapse:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>After years of one humiliating defeat after another, both the military and civil leadership of France were demoralized and discredited. When the Dauphin Charles granted Joan’s urgent request to be equipped for war and placed at the head of his army, his decision must have been based in large part on the knowledge that every orthodox, every rational option had been tried and had failed. Only a regime in the final straits of desperation would pay any heed to an illiterate farm girl who claimed that the voice of God was instructing her to take charge of her country’s army and lead it to victory.</p>

		<p>From a recent email to friends:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It strikes me that this passive aggressive/put down behaviour characterises the financial world over past few years (based on rather direct personal experience)</p>
<p>And that the recent ills of the west (recent, meaning in England beginning in 1870) are related to a sense of demoralisation.&nbsp; This latter being a word that, stripped from its roots, no longer has vitality, and can only be understood by reading it in the context of much older works.&nbsp; But in modern terms it can be seen as a basic mental variable having a profound neuroendocrine impact on global perception, processing, and decision making.</p>
<p>Without morale, people don&#8217;t even pretend to be honest, or to do what is right (but difficult).</p>
<p>For somewhat mysterious reasons this era appears now to be coming to a close.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p><a href="http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep0292104.pdf">http://www.epjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/ep0292104.pdf</a></p>
<p>The converse of the cycle of success is a maladaptive cycle associated with the negative reaction to failure and loss. In battle, it is well-known that a losing army can be paralyzed by feelings of helplessness and hopelessness so that it ceases to be an effective fighting force. One observes this too in competitive sports where an individual or a team that feels defeated loses confidence and ceases to be a threat to the opposition. This is associated with negative mood and can culminate in clinical depression (Kendler et al, 2003; Sloman, Gilbert and Hasey, 2003). </p>
<p>The maladaptive cycle is triggered by failure and becomes more likely after repeated failure, but it is not a necessary consequence of failure. For example, when the individual perceives that defeat is inevitable, it is often in his/her best interests to disengage from the struggle expeditiously. True submission involves acceptance of the subordinate role and, in primitive times, this would have served the function of avoiding serious injury or even death. However, in some cases the individual’s anger or resentment is so powerful, that he cannot submit, thus causing him to persist in a hopeless struggle. This leads, in turn, to a more powerful triggering of the individual’s subordination strategy, which is associated with escalating negative feelings of helplessness, hopelessness and inadequacy. This may eventually culminant in a clinical depression (Price et al, 1994; Sloman, 2000). In other cases, <b>the individual’s inability to handle the negative affect associated with defeat causes the individual, whose subordination strategy has already been activated, to become preoccupied with avoiding the pain of further loss.</b> This may lead to <b>fruitless power struggles characterized by an inability to admit any weakness or error and by a tendency to put others down.</b></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>China&#8217;s response to the 2008 financial crisis led to money and credit growing at a pace of 40% annualized, with a heavy focus on infrastructure.&nbsp; There were problems with malinvestment and with inflation, and clearly we should not have expected or hoped for this pace of stimulus to be sustained as the global economy recovers.&nbsp; Chinese growth has slowed since 2011, and people are today quite gloomy.&nbsp; I think we need to avoid getting distracted by tracking every blip and keep the bigger picture in mind.
<p>The bigger picture is that as China develops it needs to change its formula for growth, and that means a change in the composition of growth &#8211; over time tilting towards domestic consumption and away from exports.&nbsp; Rising Chinese wages constitute an important part of this rebalancing, even if exporters have been suffering.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a very positive thing that the authorities are letting exports slow, and not trying artificially to sustain what needs to change.
<p>Exports have also been hit by weakness in Europe, but that is a region where things are already beginning to heal.&nbsp; Public sector leverage is modest, particularly when one considers the asset side of the balance sheet.&nbsp; Ghost towns are signs of excess on the part of local authorities, but the reforms involve introducing greater rigour in the selection process for new projects.
<p>Any emerging economy goes through ups and downs, and the Chinese experience should be seen in this context.&nbsp; Somewhat slower growth in future is in accordance with the normal pattern of development.&nbsp; The authorities recognize the problems, and seem to be taking real steps to address them &#8211; that is where we ought to place our focus.
<p>People have tended to dismiss the capital market reforms as being nothing more than what was announced after the Third Plenum, and they are worried about new supply from IPOs weighing on the market.&nbsp; I think you have to see these in the context of the broader economic reforms: China is addressing its problems, and on the path to become a sophisticated, developed economy.&nbsp; Free capital markets and a decent infrastructure for their operation are indispensable for the proper allocation of capital in the economy.
<p>I am positive on Chinese equity markets, and on the prospects of economies linked to China, although I think it&#8217;s likely we see some currency weakness in the years ahead.</p>

		<p>I am aware of, and take due note of developments in fertilizers, pest control, and farm technology and also that in a more integrated world the impacts of crop failures in a single region is less acute.  This being said, it is a given that we would have seen these kinds of developments given the past evolution of the relative price of wheat, and the question is what the future holds – possibly very different developments.  In this context, then, I find the long-term chart below of the ratio of the spot wheat price to spot gold to be quite intriguing:</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Over the past few years there has been much talk of whether bonds are a bubble.</p>
<p>Given the impressive total return of fixed income since the major bottom in prices in 1981/81, it’s not surprising that people have been asking that question.  The chart below shows the roll-adjusted performance of buying the long bond future in the US.  (In other words in addition to 5% annualized return from price appreciation in excess of the forwards, investors would have received the compounded short-rate over that period).</p>
<p><a href="http://laeeth.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/image11.png"><img style="display: inline; border: 0px;" title="image" src="http://laeeth.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/image_thumb11.png" alt="image" width="543" height="218" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>And the return had one bought a 30 year zero, and rolled it each year would have been even more impressive (better than the SPX, I recollect).</p>
<p>But to speak of a bubble in bonds is to misunderstand the nature of bubbles, and the motivation for bond purchases, and the institutional structure that supports them.</p>
<p>I shall write a longer post at a later date, but bubbles are characterized by the mass psychology pattern, and not purely by price appreciation.  One can in principle and in practice observe this psychology and develop a sense for the structure of herd emotions, perceptions, and decision-making patterns.  It is important to look at this factor independently, because of the profound importance of the behavioural finance phenomenon of misattribution of mood in shaping how market participants perceive economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>In theory one could imagine bonds becoming a speculative vehicle that lies at the heart of a bubble.  One needs to consider of course that different dynamics may be playing out at different time horizons.  So for example in 1993, there certainly was a bubble in bond carry trades globally.  However it was confined more or less to the investment activities of banks, and of the then rather unimportant at a global level hedge fund sector.  So the bursting, whilst painful, had limited impact; and this occurred on a shorter-term horizon that we can now recognize was in the context of a continued long-term bull market in bonds.</p>
<p>So today, I don’t believe bonds can be thought of as a bubble at all.  What has driven appreciation since 1982 has been a reduction in real rates, a reduction in implied inflation expectations, and a reduction in the risk premium for both – this latter reflecting also a decline in macroeconomic volatility, including perceived volatility of real rates and inflation and their underlying drivers.</p>
<p>Implicitly one should note that real rates in the long term reflect expectations about growth, and that long-term inflation expectations reflect belief in the willingness and ability of central banks to maintain price stability in the medium term.</p>
<p>Consider this thought experiment.  Suppose there were to be a bubble in pessimism over growth, and belief in central banks.  What would you see?  As regards growth: one would see deep pessimism about the dynamism of the economy, a belief in secular stagnation, that productivity growth would remain soft for many years to come, that the labour market would continue to be difficult for the imaginable future.  As regards inflation, one would see a belief that the central bank was absolutely in control of inflation and could choose whichever inflation rate it desired, that we knew how to defeat inflation should it ever arrive and that in light of the negative consequences of deflation, central banks should actually try to create some inflation to truncate that tail possibility.</p>
<p>As it happens, I believe this does characterize the present.</p>
<p>For reasons I have set out before, and on which I will elaborate further in coming work, I believe both beliefs (pessimism about) growth, and belief in the power of central banks are very much misplaced and that we will shortly see a ‘marking to market’’&#8217; as economic and financial developments unfold in a manner that will surprise most observers, but nonetheless can be unanticipated via the application of Goethean <em>active perception</em> and reasoning about economics based on principles rather than mere Cartesian <em>analysis</em>.</p>
<p>I intend to write more on this in coming weeks.</p>

<div></div>
<div>One thinks also of Ibn Khaldun and his observations about civilizational renewal due to the infusion of barbarians.  (Ie new leadership will not necessarily come from those who today have the greatest prestige).</p>
</div>
<div>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah</p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Ibn Khaldun" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a> uses the term <i>Asabiyyah</i> to describe the bond of cohesion among humans in a group forming <a title="Community" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community">community</a>. The bond, Asabiyyah, exists at any level of civilization, from nomadic society to states and empires.<sup id="cite_ref-tibi_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah#cite_note-tibi-3">[3]</a></sup> Asabiyyah is most strong in the nomadic phase, and decreases as civilization advances.<sup id="cite_ref-tibi_3-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah#cite_note-tibi-3">[3]</a></sup> As this Asabiyyah declines, another more compelling Asabiyyah may take its place; thus, civilizations rise and fall, and history describes these cycles of Asabiyyah as they play out.<sup id="cite_ref-tibi_3-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asabiyyah#cite_note-tibi-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ibn Khaldun argues that each <a title="Dynasty" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty">dynasty</a> (or <a title="Civilization" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization">civilization</a>) has within itself the seeds of its own downfall. He explains that ruling houses tend to emerge on the peripheries of great <a title="Empire" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire">empires</a> and use the much stronger `asabiyya present in those areas to their advantage, in order to bring about a change in leadership. This implies that the new rulers are at first considered &#8220;<a title="Barbarian" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian">barbarians</a>&#8221; by comparison to the old ones. As they establish themselves at the center of their empire, they become increasingly lax, less coordinated, disciplined and watchful, and more concerned with maintaining their new power and lifestyle at the centre of the empire—i.e, their internal cohesion and ties to the original peripheral group, the `asabiyya, dissolves into factionalism and individualism, diminishing their capacity as a political unit. Thus, conditions are created wherein a new dynasty can emerge at the periphery of their control, grow strong, and effect a change in leadership, beginning the cycle anew.</p>
<p>Khaldun&#8217;s central concept of <i>asabiyah</i>, or &#8220;<a title="Structural cohesion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_cohesion">social cohesion</a>&#8220;, seems to anticipate modern conceptions of <a title="Social capital" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital">social capital</a> arising in <a title="Social network" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social networks</a><sup>[<i><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a></i>]</sup>:</p>
<p>This cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; and it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Khaldun&#8217;s analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds &#8211; psychological, sociological, economic, political &#8211; of the group&#8217;s downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion.<sup>[<i><a title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words">who?</a></i>]</sup></p></blockquote>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Or of Toynbee&#8217;s observations about the importance of the &#8216;creative minority&#8217; in helping a civilization adapt to new challenges:</div>
<div>
<p>. Every major civilization, Toynbee contended, goes through a series of stages: genesis, growth, breakdown, and disintegration, after which it disappears, giving way to another civilization. Discerning similarities in the social processes that occur in all civilizations, Toynbee sought to derive from them empirical laws of social development, on the basis of which it would be possible to predict major events in the modern world as well.</p>
<p>http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Toynbee,+Arnold+Joseph</p>
<blockquote><p>Following H. Bergson, Toynbee considered the moving force in a civilization’s development to be the “creative minority, ” defined as the bearer of the mystical <i>élan vital</i>. This minority, by responding successfully to various historical challenges, is able to carry the “inert majority” along with it. The nature of these challenges and responses determines the distinctive features of a civilization, among which are its hierarchy of social values and the philosophical views it holds on the meaning of life. Once a creative elite, however, proves incapable of solving the social or historical problems confronting it, it becomes a dominant minority, seeking to impose its will by force rather than through accepted authority</p></blockquote>
<p>Or here:</p>
<p>http://the-great-learning.com/toynbee.htm</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> Civilization is heavily depending on the role of a &#8220;creative minority&#8221;. Decline sets in, when the latter cannot inspire the masses anymore. Generally, leaders seem to be able but following only &#8220;one great idea&#8221;. In the beginning this great idea is the vehicle upon which society is flourishing. However, through sticking to this paradigm, despite changing circumstances, the leaders are becoming an obstacle, rather than a catalyst. Their reaction is to keep, what they have achieved, thus turning them from creative individuals into the &#8220;ruling minority&#8221;. From that moment on their only aim is to uphold their privileged position. Sooner or later this is causing a split in society between the ruling elite and the &#8220;internal proletariat&#8221;. Frenetic control, a police state and militarism are the possible consequences. The paradox is this: because of increasing expansion, aggression and military campaigns (in order to keep society together), an empire is exhausting itself. Parallels between the Roman Empire and the current US global hegemony are but all too evident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">5. The next stage in the life of a civilization is that of decay, disintegration. First of all, it is characterized by schism in the social organism, the latter falling apart in roughly three groups: ruling minority, internal proletariat and external proletariat. The ruling elite consists of all those, who are trying to keep up the status quo, like politicians, bureaucrats, moneymakers, exploiters, militarists and those who serve them, like scientists, philosophers, teachers and artists&#8230;The internal proletariat on the other hand consists of the &#8220;masses&#8221;. As long as the masses can identify itself with the aims of society, put forward by the elite, it will conform to the &#8220;general rule&#8221;. However, from the first moment, that this will be not the case anymore, the same masses start to feel alienated from the society. While the majority is staying passive, trying to distract itself in escapism, adaptation, vulgarization and resignation, a new minority will either try to revolt externally through trying to bring about social change, or by taking refuge in spirituality, trying to create an inner revolution. The external proletariat on the other hand includes all those, who do not belong to the core civilization, but are living around its borders. As long as the dominant society can keep its inspiration and radiance, these &#8220;barbarians&#8221; will try to follow its example. However, from the first moment decay is setting in, these people are becoming hostile, with time working in favor of the latter&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">6. There are three different responses to the decay, depending on the various groups in society. As has been said above, the ruling elite will try to establish and maintain a universal state or empire, in order to secure its interests. Note that an empire at the heights of its power does NOT correspond with a milestone/highlight in civilization! On the contrary, rather than being inspired by creative and beneficial values, it has turned to being dominated by a &#8220;degenerated&#8221; power elite, the latter only aiming at maintaining its own privileges. The characteristics of such an empire are emphasizing its &#8220;greatness&#8221;, developing a myth of superiority, chauvinism and nationalism, protecting its privileged position (at the expense of others), expansion of its philosophy, &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; and rule in neighboring countries, very often &#8211; especially when feeling threatened &#8211; culminating in raw militarism. The new creative minority &#8211; part of the internal proletariat &#8211; on the other hand, has been starting to develop a new spirituality, aiming at establishing a new universal religion. Although despising the aims of society (materialism, power) it is using the facilities of the empire &#8211; its &#8220;tolerance&#8221; in order to maintain &#8220;unity&#8221;, &#8220;liberties&#8221;, &#8220;stability&#8221;, &#8220;peace&#8221;, means of communication, administration and technology &#8211; to its own advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">7. The third response concerns the implosion of boundaries. Extension of empire is weakening its power to keep &#8220;things together&#8221;. Sooner or later the pressure on the &#8220;limes&#8221; (as the borders of the Roman Empire were called) will be mounting to a critical climax. Two factors are aggravating the situation. First of all, the guardians of the empire being forced to use the services of the external proletariat, in order to keep up the basic functions of society&#8230;secondly the spreading of high sophisticated weaponry in neighboring (&#8220;barbaric&#8221;) countries*. The combination of these two factors will prove to be lethal to the empire. At such a stage developments may go dramatically fast. The hatred of the surrounding societies toward the dominant one, will unleash an uncontrollable aggression, in which the former are overturning the latter, trying to get what they can get or either destroy what they can destroy. It is the stage of chaos, trouble, (immense) suffering and the birth of a new heroism, this time on the part of the invaders. It is characterized by &#8220;dark ages&#8221;, in which everything is first disintegrating, while subsequently being slowly rebuilt (something that may take centuries). The invaders &#8211; having had no experience in ruling a complicated society &#8211; appear not to be able to restore the original high standard of living. The impulse for renewal is on the other hand coming from the new religion, as being developed by the new creative minority in the last days of the original empire. Vitalized by the influx of and mixing with the former barbarians&#8230;this new religion will then be slowly penetrate the various sectors of society, transforming them according to the new teachings, starting a new round of civilization.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Note to a market contact:</p>
<p>(Images in the PDF attached &#8211; the key point is that the data gave a disastrously misleading picture of the output gap in realtime, and this was true of both the US and UK.  There is a tendency to believe that our greater sophistication and access to processing power means that we are unlikely to experience anything similar.  I do not believe such a complacent view will turn out to be justified).</p>
<p>Thank you for your thoughts on the inflation in the 1970s &#8211; as I understand it, you attribute the monetary policy mistake (we both agree there was one) to an overly political orientation of monetary policy, and a misplaced belief in the power of prices and incomes policy. Furthermore, you believe that in 1972 there was an inadequate appreciation of the combined inflationary impact of international loose monetary + fiscal policy in the context of the Vietnam war (you don’t mention it, but I would add that this came in the context of a prior commitment to Great Society programmes, and the war on poverty – guns AND butter).</p>
<p>More generally, I think that you hold to the established doctrine of 2014 – if wage inflation starts to pick up, then provided the Fed responds appropriately by raising rates, there is no reason to expect a loss of credibility, or that prior loose monetary policy will have an impact that cannot easily be defeated by tighter policy going forward.<br />
With regards to the 1970s, I have pointed to the work of Orphanides and Thomas Mayer on the real-time difficulties of assessing the output gap. In particular, the data from the 1970s was revised to give a totally different picture today from what people understood to be the case at the time. I don’t deny that mistaken views about policy mattered too. (I would put these down to a failure of nerve, and lack of backbone leading people to rationalize what seemed to be a kinder and less brutal approach of attempting to controlling inflation via prices and incomes policy rather than accepting the price in terms of higher unemployment). But making decisions on the basis of the wrong data surely played an important part.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Orphanides notes that McCallum criticized the Taylor rule as not operational because policymakers need to form a view on what is the natural rate, and what is potential output.  Greenspan – not in general the most insightful writer on macro, but who has some genuine insights amidst everything else noted that “like all rules, [Taylor-type formulations] embody a forecast that the future will be </span>like the past. Unfortunately, however, history is not an infallible guide to the future, and the levels of the two variables [the Wicksellian neutral real rate, and potential output] are currently under active debate”. Orphanides notes that “the classic Taylor rule lacks an explicit role for forecasts and related judgements about prospective economic developments”</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w13325.pdf?new_window=1">Woodford (2007)</a> seems to have been the most influential crystallization of the tendency in thought that has provided intellectual support for recent errors in monetary policy.</p>
<p>By starting with a model without money (and that does not consider the psychology that shapes its influence), he concludes unsurprisingly that money provides no useful additional information.</p>
<p>I believe that the years ahead will demonstrate the pernicious error in this way of thinking (although no doubt the inflationary episode will be blamed initially on cost-price inflation driven by food, with it being claimed that the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;tbm=nws&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=wheat+rust">supply-side shocks we are in the process of experiencing</a> could not have been foreseen).</p>

<p><span style="color: #767676; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2631578947;">&#8220;In fact, if all that one cares about is whether an average inflation rate of two percent is maintained over a period of several decades, this is quite easy to ensure. It is only necessary that one be able to measure the inflation rate itself — and not necessarily in real time; it suffices that the lag in data availability be one of weeks rather than years — and that one be able to tell whether policy is being adjusted in a way that should lower inflation as opposed to raising it (for which an interest- rate instrument suffices). A suitable policy is then one that monitors the cumulative increase in prices relative to the two-percent-per-year target, and tightens policy if prices have risen too much, loosening it if they have risen too little.</span><b style="color: #767676; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2631578947;"> One does not need to monitor money growth to tell if an undesirable long-run inflation trend is developing; measurement of </b><b style="color: #767676; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2631578947;">inflation itself </b><b style="color: #767676; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2631578947;">suffices for this!</b><span style="color: #767676; font-size: 19px; font-style: italic; line-height: 1.2631578947;"> As long as one does in fact know how to measure price increases, and to use policy to accelerate or decelerate the rate of inflation (at least over the next few years), there is little difficulty in ensuring a desired rate of inflation over a sufficiently long period of time. Of course, there are significant practical questions connected with the measurement of current inflation at high frequencies, and even greater difficulties in assessing the near-term inflation outlook given the current stance of policy; but the existence of a long-term relation between money growth and inflation does not imply any advantage of money-growth statistics in addressing those questions.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>Finally, it might be thought that the existence of a long-run relation between money growth and inflation should imply that measures of money growth will be valuable in forecasting inflation, over “the medium-to-long run” even if not at shorter horizons. But this is not the case. Cointegration of money growth with the inflation rate would imply that if one were to know what the average rate of money growth will be over some sufficiently long future horizon, one would need no other information in order to be able to forecast the average inflation rate over that same horizon. But one does not know in advance what the rate of money growth over the long run will be (that is, unless one knows it because the central bank is determined to adjust policy to ensure a particular rate of money growth). And<b> there is no reason to assume that the </b><b>recent rate of growth of the money supply provides the best predictor of the future long-run rate of money growth&#8221;.</b></p></blockquote>

		<p>I first read the work of my friend David Glasner as a student at Trinity, Cambridge in the early 90s, and I found his work on Free Banking to be amongst the best theoretically that I have read on the topic.&nbsp; I would also commend highly his masterwork of an encyclopedia on Business Cycles.</p>
<p>It is with the greatest respect therefore, that I feel compelled to use his view as a foil when setting out my own perspective.&nbsp; I am finishing up a twenty page report that Dr Marc Faber has kindly agreed to republish in his Monthly Market Commentary, but for the time being I have said the following (originally on <a href="http://uneasymoney.com/2014/03/04/why-fed-inflation-phobia-mattered/#comment-64150">Uneasy Money</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi David.
<p>I do not always agree with your perspective, but your blog is highly thought-provoking.
<p>With regards to a putative inflation-phobia amongst Fed members, in order to prove this, would it not be necessary to demonstrate not just that they were too worried about inflation in July 2008, but that they exhibited a systematic bias in this direction over the course of a few business cycles.
<p>I have myself done this work, as well as lived it since my career as an interest rate speculator began.
<p>It’s actually an exercise I suggest for new hires. Pick a chart of the 2 year T note in your favourite country. Circle the major turning points – highs and lows – and pull up the official minutes, the transcripts (if available) and speeches and comments from central banking officials at the times of these major highs and lows.
<p>The general pattern (and it is pretty consistent) is that policymakers are always ‘wrong’ (ie biased in the direction of the previous trend, and implicitly extrapolating recent developments at that point, and not anticipating the shifts in basic economic conditions that subsequently lead to a change in direction. I am implicitly asking you to trust me here that when the market changes direction it is associated with a run of data releases that support the change in direction. However, I am pretty sure that you will arrive at the same result if you look more directly at shifts in the trend of data representing economic activity itself and study the evolution of the rhetoric around these turning points.
<p>One has the same experience talking to policymakers directly as one lives through major turning points.
<p>Remember summer 2003 when there were all these worries about deflation? A certain former Fed official very close to Greenspan and who retained very good contacts at the Fed after he moved to his consulting business came by and saw us in London. He is a very nice man, and very bright. However, instead of explaining why CPI was artificially depressed due to used cars (0% financing for new cars) and owner’s equivalent rent (utilities are packaged with housing, and energy went up whilst rents did not – perhaps a question of temporarily sticky prices), his focus was on exactly how the Fed might buy bonds, and the particular operational challenges of doing so. All terribly interesting, but of not practical investment utility because the deflation scare was based upon spurious considerations.
<p>So there is one counterexample for you. The Fed were too worried about inflation in July 2008, and too worried about deflation in July 2003.
<p>The point is that policymakers and conventional economists simply do not have a good record of anticipating economic shifts, as these economic shifts are never seen first in hard data whilst no respectable economist is able to avoid looking primarily at the hard data even though he may know in his heart of hearts that it doesn’t anticipate the future at the very time you most need to be able to do so.
<p>I believe that my points stand on their own, but for what it is worth I did anticipate a deflation bust in July to early August 2008 as commodities and breakeven inflation (the market’s implied anticipation of future inflation) topped, and also the bottom in early Jan 2009 as they bottomed. I may post a link to pieces written at that time in case it may be of interest,
<p>So either I am talking nonsense about the central banks being consistently wrong when things shift (I am not, and you can do the work yourself in a few hours), or you are obliged to go further in demonstrating that not only are they always wrong at turns, but they are especially wrong at disinflationary turns.
<p>(I note that the ECB is perhaps worse than the Fed in this respect. Because of the rather Buba-inspired doctrine of ‘steady hand’ in setting monetary policy, the ECB doesn’t like to change direction in a hurry even when the picture is clearly – to someone who thinks in the way I do – shifting against the old trend. So for example in July 2008, the last ECB hike was exactly the opposite of what was required, and similarly in July 2012).
<p>One question I have for you that is less about logic, and more about one’s approach to being open to modifying one’s thought process in the light of surprises. Suppose that inflation turns out to be substantially higher over the next 3-5 years in the face of policy that is not substantially more accommodative than at present. (Such an outturn likely being signalled rather sooner than 3-5 years by a large rally in breakeven inflation rates).
<p>Would that make you open to reconsidering your perspective and the mode of thought behind it? If so, would you mind if I set a note in my calendar for 18 months time so we can revisit this discussion?
<p>I happen to have a different view to you, and I have set it out in the piece I emailed. This view is based upon the idea that one loses a great deal by doing only analysis and paying inordinate attention to hard data susceptible to models rather than softer, more inchoate impressions about which one may nonetheless think in a systematic fashion.
<p>“its pathological nature at those meetings does have a certain breathtaking quality; it had already been operating for a long time before that. If you look at the St. Louis Fed’s statistics on the monetary base, you will find that the previous recession in 2001 had been preceded in 2000 by a drop of 3.6% in the monetary base.”
<p>3.6% sure doesn’t seem like much given that the Fed eased aggressively in quantitative terms in 1999 to be sure nothing would go wrong over Y2K. given the extent to which they eased, was it really so wrong to take a little bit back? bear in mind the insane equity environment at the time (I do think the Y2K ease in 1999 was responsible for that last leg up that damaged so many reputations of those who had the right view but were just a bit early).
<p>“The housing bubble burst in 2006, but the Fed was evidently determined to squeeze inflation out of the system, as if trying to atone for its sins in allowing the housing bubble in the first place.”
<p>well, it is an open question as to whether the bubble was in housing or credit. I believe it was the latter, and that that is where the real excesses were. my explanation – of a global credit bubble originally triggered by a desperate search for yield at the 2003 low in yields, but one that eventually took on a life of its own – is much more parsimonious as it explains the insanity distributed around the world. you have to have lots of stories that are not obviously linked – one for US and Irish housing, another for Dubai infrastructure, another for industrial-commodity linked plays, another for European peripheral credit.
<p>bear in mind that in this context, although US housing showed clear signs of weakness already in 2006 (and I asked Kohn about it at lunch just after he had been made vice-chair and he wasn’t worried about housing, or the impact of resets – and to be honest nobody else at lunch was worried either), credit spreads continued to compress into February 2007. and since the excesses were clearly in credit (I trust you will grant that at least they were clearly, also, in credit) and the overwhelming consensus economic view (I couldn’t find a soul on my side back then) was that we had rare synchronized global growth, it wasn’t unreasonable within the way the Fed thinks about the world to keep tightening.
<p>“If the Fed had moderated its stance in 2008 in response to ample evidence that the economy was slowing, there is good reason to think that the economy would not have contracted as rapidly as it did, starting, even before the Lehman collapse, in the third quarter of 2008, when, we now know, the economy had already begun one of the sharpest contractions of the entire post World War II era”.
<p>it would have been better if they had eased more quickly. however 1) do you believe there was a credit bubble? 2) can you find any instance of a credit bubble bursting that was not horrible, to a greater or lesser extent?
<p>bear in mind also that the Fed has institutional memory of making the opposite kind of mistake. The Fed loosened in response to the 87 crash (which if you study the sectoral capacity utilisation data turned out to be associated with a shift in the pattern of economic activity, although not a collapse)i, and arguably that made the subsequent S&amp;L bust worse when the silly boom did finally reach its natural conclusion.
<p>“A financial panic is an acute breakdown of the financial system, always associated with a period of monetary stringency when demands for liquidity cannot be satisfied owing to a contagious loss of confidence in the solvency of borrowers and lenders. The crisis is typically precipitated by a too aggressive tightening of monetary conditions by the monetary authority seeking to rein in inflationary pressures.”
<p>Like the panics of 1907, 1914, 1873, the Overend and Guerney episode and the C19 Barings crisis? Would we not be better off returning to the doctrine of Mills and recognize that a panic is a mass psychological phenomenon relating to a loss of confidence in credit that we still do not fully understand and are unable to predict and that may have multiple triggers, and monetary policy tightening may serve as one of these?
<p>Is there any real evidence to suggest that over-tightening monetary policy has a particular tendency to induce panics, and that the great preponderance of panics have been induced by too-tight policy? Bear in mind that pre central banking it is hard to untangle cause from effect, since a loss of confidence would be reflected in a loss of specie and tendency to force the central bank to tighten to protect its reserve. And on the other hand, post central banking a panic arriving some way into the boom from causes that are putatively of non-monetary policy origin will ex post facto make it appear that obviously policy was too tight, when it simply wasn’t realistically clear to anyone at the time not successfully peering into the misty future.
<p>Shall we put it another way? Of people writing in the period say June 2006-July 2008, which serious people were warning of a credit bust and nasty downturn in the economy. And which of these were right for the right reason, and have had a consistently good track-record rather than being permanently bearish? A stopped clock will be right twice a day.
<p>I know of two: Marc Faber, and Jim Rogers. Marc has the perception of being permanently bearish, but if one reads his serious work rather than just listening to how he is forced to simplify it on TV, one may see that he wrote in summer 2003 a piece on reflation. Fred Sheehan, Kurt Richebacher and Doug Noland were ultimately right for a while, but one must recognize too that they started sounding the warning alarms rather too early! (This may be unfair to Sheehan as I don’t recall so clearly now).
<p>And for what it is worth, personally I did speak to the IMF Financial Stability chap in early 2005 at the request of the Bank of England. Quaintly, they were worried about the USD/JPY carry trade by hedge funds (always fighting the last war, these policy-makers). I told him not to worry about the hedge funds, but about the banks, and what they were buying. I wasn’t the only practitioner to see things developing nastily, but there was a very limited audience for this kind of view, and it was perceived as extreme and investors are put off by this kind of thing.
<p>One should also credit Crispin Odey, who put out (rather early) a very good study on the emerging credit bubble by a serious student of bubbles (whose name temporarily escapes me).
<p>Don’t you see it as a problem to explain what the Fed should have done after the fact bearing in mind one had the opportunity to say so at the time, and for whatever reason chose not to say so? Wouldn’t it be more in keeping with the scientific spirit to make pattern predictions?
<p>- the Fed is currently doing X. I believe X’ would be more appropriate, and really, Y is the proper policy<br />- if it continues to do X, as I believe likely, then this is the shape of events that I believe is likely.
<p>I shall throw a hostage to fortune and suggest the following
<p>a. central banks have maintained very easy policy for too long in the belief that the labour market (and maintaining nominal GDP growth) is what is key and in the belief that inflation is the least of their worries following a financial crisis and that should it begin to appear this is a problem that they know well how to solve and that they will at that point act promptly to raise rates and that this will eliminate any prospect of serious inflation taking hold (bearing in mind that it would be desirable to risk somewhat higher median inflation to truncate the disastrous tail of deflation)
<p>b. forward guidance (as adopted most clearly by the bank of england) makes sense if the central bank has superior insight to the market. however central banks (and the Old Lady is no exception) have a horrible track record in economic forecasting, whereas historically market movements in yields anticipate shifts in economic activity much better than any forecasting model not itself incorporating such shifts. since the central bank is only able to react with a lag, and in fact has committed itself to act late, this is a recipe for instability.
<p>c. as the work of Samuel Reynard at the SNB demonstrates, it simply is not the case that post financial crisis the link between money/credit and inflation breaks down. what happens is that so long as risk appetite is depressed it does, but risk appetite can shift quickly. when that happens, a great deal of inflation is baked in the cake and it is simply too late to get to price stability without an unacceptable loss of output, whatever comforting stories central bankers tell themselves in order to be able to sleep at night.
<p>d. the labour market has been horrible. it has lately been perking up, and is likely to do so dramatically on a 2-3 year horizon.
<p>e. when this happens there is going to be payback time for the period of subdued wage growth that followed 2000. offshoring and automation as net job destroying processes may turn out to be yesterday’s story. furthermore rising rates will tend to make it less attractive at the margin to replace labour by capital (noting also that a one-shot adjustment lower in rates leads to a stock adjustment spread out in time, meaning that one is in for a surprise if one extrapolates the spurt of adjustment forward indefinitely into the future).
<p>f. inflation is going a lot higher over the next 3-5 years (and we should see breakeven inflation rise markedly, even on an 18 month horizon).
<p>I do hope the tone of my comment is not unduly combative. I believe this is the critical question of the moment, and would love to hear how I am mistaken.
<p>&nbsp;

		<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">My personal view is that it seems political instability precedes hyperinflation (which tends to be associated with a loss of confidence not just in the monetary, but also political authorities).</span></p>
<p>Trends often go parabolic when they end, and it may be we have many more years of relative economic stability ahead before the denouement of a situation where the seeds of the ultimate outcome are already today present and nascent.</p>
<p>However, it is not too soon to contemplate this scenario as one possible end-game even if one avoids explicitly betting on this today.  The problem really comes in a future cycle where there may be a conflict between financial stability &#8211; given the Wadhwani effect &#8211; and targeting price stability.</p>
<p>What is the Wadhwani effect?  I believe it was given this name by Sir Alan Budd in a paper I read in the late 1980s, but I have not been able to learn from Dr Wadhwani or other sources where this was first described.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where the real rate is 2% and inflation is zero – a $2mm apartment will cost $40,000 per annum to finance, and this may be seen as eminently affordable for a certain set of potential purchasers.  Consider on the other hand a scenario where the real rate is -2% and inflation is 12%, implying a nominal rate of 10%.</p>
<p>Surely an excellent scenario for the owner of such an asset who has financed it with debt, and who will repay the debt with depreciated dollars!  Unfortunately, this would imply a financing cost of $200,000, which will push the asset out of the affordability of many of the original set of purchasers and is likely to serve to depress its price on the relevant investment horizon.  Now this illustration was entirely theoretical, since I don’t expect inflation in the developed world to reach this level for some time – but it ought to be quite clear that there are circumstances in which real estate may not serve as effectively as an inflation hedge as many today believe.</p>
<p>Specifically, it means that to a certain extent it will be the level of nominal rates that it is important for asset prices (often held on a levered basis).  So if one starts from a situation where the debt stock is high, it may be difficult to raise real rates sustainably to a positive level.  Conventional wisdom that thinks in terms of inflation being driven by output-gap type models would suggest that this is not a problem for inflation, given that financial distress will exert a drag on demand, with the consequence that inflation ought not to be a problem (even if the distress occurs at a negative level of real rates): by the time distress occurs, inflation is the last thing one ought to worry about.</p>
<p>But this presumes that the central bank is successful in keeping inflation expectations anchored.  The fashion today is to believe that thanks to credibility induced by advanced econometric modelling, devotion to inflation as a primary target, and superior transparency and communications, it simply is not a risk that the central bank loses credibility.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this will be borne out by developments in subsequent years.  Credibility relates to trust, and trust is a feeling with neurophysiological correlates that has a logic of its own and is to a certain extent susceptible to contagion and the influence of mass psychology.  People do not always act rationally when they are part of a crowd, and this is worse when conventional anchors have been unmoored.</p>
<p>We experienced this during the 60s, where as inflation in the West started to pick up, people were initially habituated to the stability induced by many previous decades of experienced under the gold standard.  When that belief was destroyed, it was shocking to most observers how quickly inflation appeared to develop a momentum of its own.</p>
<p>The situation today is rather different.  Although there is a &#8216;wild-eyed&#8217; fringe that has predicted for some years now that the historic monetary expansion post the 2007/2008 crisis would lead eventually to galloping, and perhaps even hyper- inflation, their credibility (one might prefer the term used by Gustave Le Bon &#8211; &#8216;prestige&#8217;) has been severely dented by the failure of inflation to appear.  For the most part, all sound and reasonable thinkers are quite certain that inflation is the least of our problems for the time being.</p>
<p>My point is that should &#8211; despite the clearly and rationally articulated logical explanations why this cannot happen &#8211; inflation actually in coming years start to pick up, the prestige, and therefore the credibility, of central banks is likely to be rather more fragile than people realize today.  There is a degree of complacency &#8211; &#8216;inflation is a problem we know how to defeat&#8217; that is very different from the attitude customary amongst economists when I started studying the subject in the 1980s.  And this complacency has fed through into a de facto emphasis on factors beyond price stability.</p>
<p>That remarkably un-politically-correct genius of social science, Gustave Le Bon, wrote in his 1895 study of mass psychology (&#8220;The Crowd&#8221;):</p>
<blockquote><p>Great power is given to ideas propagated by affirmation,<br />
repetition, and contagion by the circumstance that they acquire in time that mysterious force known as prestige.</p>
<p>Whatever has been a ruling power in the world, whether it be<br />
ideas or men, has in the main enforced its authority by means of that irresistible force expressed by the word &#8220;prestige.&#8221; The<br />
term is one whose meaning is grasped by everybody, but the wordis employed in ways too different for it to be easy to define it.  Prestige may involve such sentiments as admiration or fear.<br />
Occasionally even these sentiments are its basis, but it can<br />
perfectly well exist without them.</p>
<p><strong>Prestige in reality is a sort of domination exercised on our mind </strong><strong>by an individual, a work, or an idea. This domination entirely </strong><strong>paralyses our critical faculty</strong>, and fills our soul with<br />
astonishment and respect. The sentiment provoked is<br />
inexplicable, like all sentiments, but it would appear to be of<br />
the same kind as the fascination to which a magnetised person is subjected. Prestige is the mainspring of all authority. Neither<br />
gods, kings, nor women have ever reigned without it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The special characteristic of prestige is to prevent us seeing things as they are and to entirely paralyse our judgement.</strong> Crowds always, and individuals as a rule, stand in need of ready-made opinions on all subjects. The popularity of these opinions is independent of the measure of truth or error they contain, and is solely regulated by their prestige.</p>
<p><strong>It is seen from what precedes that a number of factors may be </strong><strong>concerned in the genesis of prestige; among them success was </strong><strong>always one of the most important. Every successful man, every </strong><strong>idea that forces itself into recognition, ceases, ipso facto, to </strong><strong>be called in question. The proof that success is one of the </strong><strong>principal stepping-stones to prestige is that the disappearance </strong><strong>of the one is almost always followed by the disappearance of the other. The hero whom the crowd acclaimed yesterday is insulted to-day should he have been overtaken by failure. The reaction, indeed, will be the stronger in proportion as the prestige has been great.</strong> The crowd in this case considers the fallen hero as an equal, and takes its revenge for having bowed to a superiority whose existence it no longer admits. While Robespierre was causing the execution of his colleagues and of a great number of his contemporaries, he possessed an immense prestige. When the transposition of a few votes deprived him of power, he immediately lost his prestige, and the crowd followed him to the guillotine with the self-same imprecations with which shortly before it had pursued his victims. Believers always break the statues of their former gods with every symptom of fury.</p>
<p>Prestige lost by want of success disappears in a brief space of<br />
time. It can also be worn away, but more slowly by being<br />
subjected to discussion. This latter power, however, is<br />
exceedingly sure. <strong>From the moment prestige is called in question it ceases to be prestige. The gods and men who have kept their prestige for long have never tolerated discussion. For the crowd to admire, it must be kept at a distance</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one believes Le Bon to be right in his understanding, one may wonder about how wise it may turn out to have been to demystify the workings of the central bank and monetary policy.  But the really key point is that the credibility of central banks is more fragile than currently perceived.  They have it, until they don&#8217;t.  At that point, we may be surprised at just how quickly expectations shift.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say that I see hyperinflation &#8211; even in some decades &#8211; as a central scenario, and I certainly do not expect it imminently.  But given the consequences for asset pricing, it is perhaps worth spending some time exploring its eventual possibility.</p>
<p>Reproduced with permission:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>It is worth remembering that Ben Bernanke in his now widely quoted “Deflation; Making  Sure “It” Doesn’t Happen Here speech of November 2002 argued that deflation is in fact  quite easy to deal with: “The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press  (or, today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it  wishes at essentially no cost. By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation, or  even by credibly threatening to do so, the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a  dollar in terms of goods and services, which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars  of those goods and services. We conclude that, under a paper-money system, a  determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation”.</p>
<p>Could it be that we are waging an Orwellian war against an enemy that only really exists  as a figment of our imaginations? Japan for example “suffered” deflation in its lost  decade right? Wrong. Deflation is defined as a sustained decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Even though asset prices fell precipitously over this period<br />
(1992-2001) consumer prices actually rose by nearly 2%. Core consumer prices (ex-food and energy) rose by 3%. Neither did money supply contract: during the lost decade the money base doubled and the broad measure M2 + CDs rose at an annualized rate of 2.7%.</p>
<p>Not only are the arguments against deflation overstated, and the Japanese experience misrepresented, the benefits of deflation are rarely articulated. Nobody would dispute that inflation is a bad thing for consumers, other things equal, because it erodes their purchasing power. Analogously deflation is a good thing, other things equal, because it boosts consumer purchasing power. Few would argue that the collapse in oil prices between July and December 2008 was a bad thing, and it was perhaps the most important reason why US consumption stabilized in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
<p>In the last ten years to 2007 the price of personal computers has fallen at an average rate of 19% a year in the US. Over the same period, nominal spending on personal computers has risen at annual rate of 6%, implying a 31% real annual increase (1998 to 2007). This example illustrates that the income effect – the boost to purchasing power from falling prices – will easily dominate any tendency for buyers to sit back and let prices fall.</p>
<p>Benign deflations associated with technological advances are usually a good thing. And if a malign deflation threatens – defined as a deflation associated with a contraction of money and credit – then as Bernanke articulated central banks can deal with the problem. Institutionalized inflation targets, ostensibly designed to guard against inflation, tend to be set around a small positive rate of inflation, say 2%, where the purchasing power of money roughly halves once a generation. This is not really price stability; it is in fact a continuation of the steep upward sloping line in chart three. The rationale for positive inflation targets is that it gives monetary policy more wiggle room – i.e., scope to manipulate real rates negative if necessary &#8211; and Keynesian nominal wage rigidity may worsen the alleged trade-off between inflation and unemployment below a certain rate of inflation. However nominal wage rigidity is arguably an outdated 20th century concept, which has been rendered obsolete in a globalised labor market. Moreover, if credit targeting is a superior regime to interest rate targeting then the wiggle room problem is also rendered obsolete. In a credit targeting regime, genuine price stability &#8211; a stabilization of the price level &#8211; would be a more likely proposition.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Given the enormous and unprecedented policy stimulus, risks are weighted to continued positive data surprises, unless or until the bond market collapses under its own colossal weight. Rather than allow the end of cycle cleansing to run its natural course the thrust of policy is to rekindle credit creation, but this can only happen if asset prices can be manipulated higher. Essentially policymakers are repeating the same mistakes of the past but in much bigger doses. The scope for this to end up in tears is considerable. The risks are skewed to inflation rather than deflation given the scale of policy stimulus already put in place, and because of the deafening chorus for policymakers to be brave and not withdraw stimulus prematurely when their<br />
track record has been to leave stimulus in place for too long.</p>
<p>We may be about to enter the second crisis of Keynesian economics as the economy catches a dose of stagflation, something that many economists will claim cannot happen in the current environment. In a worst case the policy response to the end of the great moderation will sow the seeds of the collapse of our fiat money system. The next policy template is likely to be based on sound money and fiscal responsibility.</p></blockquote>
