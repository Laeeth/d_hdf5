		Based on h5ex_d_alloc.c
		  This example shows how to set the space allocation time
		  for a dataset.  The program first creates two datasets,
		  one with the default allocation time (late) and one with
		  early allocation time, and displays whether each has been
		  allocated and their allocation size.  Next, it writes data
		  to the datasets, and again displays whether each has been
		  allocated and their allocation size.",
