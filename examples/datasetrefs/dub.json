	 This program shows how to create, store and dereference references
    to the dataset regions.

    It creates a file and writes a two dimensional integer dataset
    to it. Then it creates a dataset to store region references in. It
    stores references to a hyperslab and 3 points selected (for the
    integer dataset previously created).

    It then reopens the references dataset, reads and dereferences the
    region references, and then reads and displays the selected hyperslab
    and selected elements data from the integer dataset.
