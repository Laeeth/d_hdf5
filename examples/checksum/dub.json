		Based on h5ex_d_checksum.c
		  This example shows how to read and write data to a dataset
		  using the Fletcher32 checksum filter.  The program first
		  checks if the Fletcher32 filter is available, then if it
		  is it writes integers to a dataset using Fletcher32, then
		  closes the file.  Next, it reopens the file, reads back
		  the data, checks if the filter detected an error and
		  outputs the type of filter and the maximum value in the
		  dataset to the screen.
