	Based on h5ex_d_chunk.c
	    This example shows how to create a chunked dataset.  The
	    program first writes integers in a hyperslab selection to
	    a chunked dataset with dataspace dimensions of DIM0xDIM1
	    and chunk size of CHUNK0xCHUNK1, then closes the file.
	    Next, it reopens the file, reads back the data, and
	    outputs it to the screen.  Finally it reads the data again
	    using a different hyperslab selection, and outputs
	    the result to the screen.
