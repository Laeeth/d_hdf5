	*  This program shows how the H5Sselect_hyperslab and H5Sselect_elements
 *  functions are used to write selected data from memory to the file.
 *  Program takes 48 elements from the linear buffer and writes them into
 *  the matrix using 3x2 blocks, (4,3) stride and (2,4) count.
 *  Then four elements  of the matrix are overwritten with the new values and
 *  file is closed. Program reopens the file and selects the union of two
 *  hyperslabs in the dataset in the file. Then it reads the selection into the
 *  memory dataset preserving the shape of the selection.
