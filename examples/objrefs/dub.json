	       This program illustrates how references to objects can be used.
         Program creates a dataset and a group in a file. It also creates
         second dataset, and references to the first dataset and the group
         are stored in it.
         Program reopens the file and reads dataset with the references.
         References are used to open the objects. Information about the
         objects is displayed.",
