		This program illustrates the usage of the H5A Interface functions.
		It creates and writes a dataset, and then creates and writes array,
		scalar, and string attributes of the dataset.
		Program reopens the file, attaches to the scalar attribute using
		attribute name and reads and displays its value. Then index of the
		third attribute is used to read and display attribute values.
		The H5Aiterate function is used to iterate through the dataset attributes,
		and display their names. The function is also reads and displays the values
		of the array attribute.
