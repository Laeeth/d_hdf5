  This example shows how to read and write a complex
  compound datatype to a dataset.  The program first writes
  complex compound structures to a dataset with a dataspace
  of DIM0, then closes the file.  Next, it reopens the file,
  reads back selected fields in the structure, and outputs
  them to the screen.

  Unlike the other datatype examples, in this example we
  save to the file using native datatypes to simplify the
  type definitions here.  To save using standard types you
  must manually calculate the sizes and offsets of compound
  types as shown in h5ex_t_cmpd.c, and convert enumerated
  values as shown in h5ex_t_enum.c.

  The datatype defined here consists of a compound
  containing a variable-length list of compound types, as
  well as a variable-length string, enumeration, double
  array, object reference and region reference.  The nested
  compound type contains an int, variable-length string and
  two doubles.
