  This example shows how to create and extend an unlimited
  dataset.  The program first writes integers to a dataset
  with dataspace dimensions of DIM0xDIM1, then closes the
  file.  Next, it reopens the file, reads back the data,
  outputs it to the screen, extends the dataset, and writes
  new data to the extended portions of the dataset.  Finally
  it reopens the file again, reads back the data, and
  outputs it to the screen.
